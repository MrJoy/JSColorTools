The particular problem solved is lerping between colors in a\r\nmore visually pleasing way than one can achieve by doing so in the HSB color\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nTo that end, this library provides two classes:  `RGBColor`, and `HSBColor`,\r\nalong with functions to convert between them and to do angular lerping between\r\nHSB colors.\r\n\r\nA prime example of this is lerping between red and green smoothly.  Done in RGB\r\ncolorspace, the midpoint will be brown.  Done in HSB colorspace, it will be\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCreate instances of `RGBColor`, or `HSBColor` by providing the components as\r\nparameters to the constructors.  They include an alpha component and the scale\r\nis from 0..1, as opposed to the 0..255 that you may be accustomed to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar red = new RGBColor(1, 0, 0, 1),\r\n  green = new RGBColor(0, 1, 0, 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can convert an `RGBColor` or `HSBColor` into an HTML color string, for\r\nexample to set the background color of an element:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Set the background color without including an alpha value.\r\ndocument.getElementById(\"someElement\").style.backgroundColor = red.toHTML();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can convert an `RGBColor` to an `HSBColor`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar redAsHSB = red.toHSB(),\r\n  greenAsHSB = green.toHSB();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can lerp (blend) between two `RGBColor`s and then convert the result into\r\nan HTML color string, for example to set the background color of an element:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar resultHSB = HSBColor.lerp(red.toHSB(), green.toHSB(), 0.5);\r\ndocument.getElementById('someElement').style.backgroundColor = resultHSB.toHTML();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if you want, you can even get an HTML color with an alpha value, although\r\nthis doesn't work in most contexts:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconsole.log(red.toHTML(true));\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis code is distributed under the MIT license, see the file MIT-LICENSE for\r\nmore information.\r\n","tagline":"Some simple tools for working with colors and colorspaces in JavaScript."}
